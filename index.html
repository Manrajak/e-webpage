                that is used to train U.S. Navy, Army, and Coast Guard Ship captains. Thus, popular PokemonGo is an
                example of AR.
                <br><br>
                Highly Capable of Creating Products-This is the reason why VR and AR carry potential in training,
                entertainment, education, marketing, and even rehabilitation after an injury. This is used to train
                doctors to do surgery, offer museum-goers a deeper experience, enhance theme parks, and also increase
                marketing. The all-new Pepsi Max Bus Shelter is one such example of it.
                <br><br>
                Seeds the Demand for Job Growth- Google, Samsung, and Oculus are the key players in the VR market and
                this is the reason behind the formation of start-ups and help in hiring and fulfilling the demands of IT
                professionals with VR and AR skills.
                <br><br>
                Understanding of Basic Knowledge- This is the reason that if the person wishes to get started with VR,
                then he may not require a lot of specialized knowledge. Only basic programming skills and a
                forward-thinking mindset can help one to get a job in the IT market.

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Newly Emerging Technology-Though Cyber Security might not be viewed as
                an emerging technology but it has been around for a while and it has evolved like the way other

                Invades Hacking-This has curbed the practices of hacking by invading the malevolent hackers who search
                illegal ways of accessing the data have continued to find even the toughest security measures. Many web
                developers have started to foster new technology to enhance security. Cyber securities have continued to
                grow in recent times and their growth is the mere reflection of developed economies across the globe.

                The rise in the Job Market-This is the reason why there has been a sudden increase in the job creation
                of cyber-security professionals and the overall number of cyber-security jobs has outgrown thrice as in
                comparison to other tech-related jobs. According to the survey by Gartner, there will be the job
                creation of more than 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs by 2021.
                <br><br>
                High-salary-This is the reason why many cyber-security jobs pay six-figures incomes and its roles can
                range from the ethical hacker position to security engineer to Chief Security Officer and helps an IT
                professional who can fetch the promising career path for anybody who wishes to stick with this domain.

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Offers Security- Since many people think that blockchain technology is
                related to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and it offers security that is coined to be useful in many
                industrial domains. In simplest words, it is described as the data that can only be added and not taken
                away from any type of data warehouse store.
                <br><br>
                Links Data To Many Sources- Hence the term “Chain” is used because it is used for making the chain of
                data. Moreover, block-chains are classified as consensus-driven and it enables one entity to take
                control of the data.
                <br><br>
                Enhances Trust- Thus with the help of block-chain, one cannot trust the third party to oversee or even
                validate the transactions and thus this is referred to as the blockchain's major importance.
                <br><br>
                Used By Many Industries- Several industries involved in the implementation of the blockchain and use the
                blockchain technology that has increased in contrast to the increases in the demand for skilled
                professionals. According to Techcrunch.com, there is a prediction of 14 job openings for almost every
                blockchain developer.
                <br><br>
                Develops the Software Architecture- A blockchain developer is someone who is specialized in developing
                and implementing architecture and solutions by using blockchain technology. The average salary of the
                blockchain developer is USD 3,10,000.
                <br><br>
                If you are intrigued by the applications made on blockchain technology then it is the right time for one
                to learn Blockchain and even gear up for the exciting future.
